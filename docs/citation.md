title:  HMT editions are citable
---


## Citation



The HMT project uses IETF-standard URN notation for all scholarly citation.  URNs are text strings with a specified syntax and semantics.  They are independent of any specific technology, can be parsed by human readers, and are machine-actionable.

Citation uses

All editions of the HMT project are citable with CTS URNs.


## Citing texts

The `hmt-textmodel` library uses the generic `ohco2` library for two important  constructs:

1.  a `Corpus` of texts, made from a Vector of `CitableNode`s.
2.  the `CitableNode` object, a single citable passage of text with URN and text content
