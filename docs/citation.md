title:  HMT editions are citable
---



All editions of the HMT project are citable with CTS URNs.

The `hmt-textmodel` library uses the generic `ohco2` library for two important  constructs:

1.  a `Corpus` of texts, made from a Vector of `CitableNode`s.
2.  the `CitableNode` object, a single citable passage of text with URN and text content
