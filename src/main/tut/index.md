## Overview

"Digital reading" does not simply mean displaying a digital document for human readers.  It means that a machine can unambiguously parse a text into units with specified semantics.

The `hmt-textmodel` library allows you to do this with the digital editions of the HMT project.

## Contents


-   HMT editions are [canonically citable](citation)
-   digital editions
-   diplomatic editions
-   The contents of citable passages are [analyzed tokens](tokens)
