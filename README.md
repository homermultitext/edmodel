# edmodel

Editions of the HMT project follow the OHCO2 model for citable .  In addition, the text contents of citable nodes are modelled as a sequence of tokens with multiple properties.

The initial focus of the library is code to instantiate this model from TEI-conformant XML following HMT guidelines.

## Status

 The library is in development. The current test suite defines approximatel 50 tests that specify its basic functionality.  To see which specifiying tests have been successfully implemented and passed, run `sbt test`.
