# HMT text model

Editions of the HMT project follow the OHCO2 model for citable texts.

This library supports working with the text contents of citable nodes as a sequence of tokens with specified properties.

The initial focus of the library is instantiating this model from TEI-conformant XML following HMT guidelines, and generating a variety of analytical exemplars from the resulting analyses.

## Current version: 2.0.0

 The library is in early but active development.

 See [release notes](releases.md) beginning with version 1.3.




## Building

Requires scala 2.11 or higher.  Binaries compiled with Scala 2.11 and 2.12 are available from bintray.

## Examples of usage

Documentation is being added at <https://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-textmodel>
