# HMT text model


`hmt-textmodel` is a cross-platform library modelling the content of texts edited by the Homer Multitext project.  On the JVM platform, the library provides classes for reading TEI-compliant XML documents following the HMT project's guidelines.  ([This project's wiki](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-textmodel/wiki) includes a brief summary of permitted usage.)

Editions of the HMT project follow the OHCO2 model for citable texts.  In both the JVM and Javascript environments, the library models the contents of a citable text as a sequence of citable tokens with specified properties.


## Current version: 6.0.1

The library is in active development.

See [release notes](releases.md) beginning with version 1.3.
