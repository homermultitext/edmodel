# HMT text model

Editions of the HMT project follow the OHCO2 model for citable texts.

`hmt-textmodel` is a JVM library that supports working with the text contents of citable nodes as a sequence of tokens with specified properties.

The initial focus of the library is instantiating this model from TEI-conformant XML following HMT guidelines, and generating a variety of analytical exemplars from the resulting analyses.


## Quick summary of XML usage
